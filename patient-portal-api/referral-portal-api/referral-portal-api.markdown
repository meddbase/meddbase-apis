# Referral Portal API

The Referral Portal is a chargeable feature that allows company’s managers to:

- refer patients
- manager users (managers)
- access basic referral reports

The Referral Portal API extends the Patient Portal API with three new sections:

- Users – provides methods to manage managers
- Patients – provides methods to find patients or create new patients
- Referrals – provides methods to start a new referral, work with referral and read reports

The Referral Portal API also extends the existing Patient Portal API methods with new parameters (usually parameter referral and patient within sections Appointments and Feeds).
