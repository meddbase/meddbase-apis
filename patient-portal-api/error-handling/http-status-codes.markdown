# HTTP status codes

In general, the Meddbase API can generate these codes:

| 200 | OK  |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 201 | Created (Saved) |     |
| 204 | No Content. | Request was successful and does not need to return a response. |
| 400 | Bad request | Bad parameter format, missing parameter etc. |
| 401 | Unauthorised | You are not authorised (If a session ID was provided then an Unauthorised exception indicates session expiry). See Login to find out more about authorization. |
| 403 | Forbidden | You don’t have rights to perform current operation. |
| 404 | Not found |     |
| 405 | Method not allowed | For example when you use GET instead of POST. |
| 424 | Method Failure |     |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |     |
| 501 | Not implemented |     |

The table above doesn’t contain all HTTP status codes that can be generated by the Meddbase server and not all responses from the server contains the ServiceExceptionData object.
