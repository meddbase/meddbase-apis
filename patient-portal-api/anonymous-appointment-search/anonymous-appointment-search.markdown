# Anonymous Appointment Search


This section provides methods for making anonymous (i.e. not authenticated) appointment searches. The methods are deliberately similar to the appointment search API documented in section 9 ‘Appointments’.

Each method in this section needs the client to provide the ASP.NET_SessionId key in a cookie (see [Login](../authentication/login)).
