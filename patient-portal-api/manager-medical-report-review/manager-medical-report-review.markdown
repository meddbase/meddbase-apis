# Manager Medical Report Review

This section provides methods to manage a review of the medical report by the manager. The manager doesn’t need to be logged in. The client has to provide the client key only (see Client authentication).

Workflow: The manager gets the email which includes URL address to the online portal and the validation key (URL get parameter). The client needs to provide validation key within each request in this section.
