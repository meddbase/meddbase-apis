# Communication overview

This section provides basic information how the client communicates with the Meddbase Patient Portal API.

The API provides:

- working with patient’s profile
- managing appointments
- filling out questionnaires
- messaging with clinicians
- review patient’s medical history

The API is designed as a REST service. The client uses HTTP GET and POST request to communicate with the server. All POST data and all GET response data is formatted in the JSON data format.
